# Kevin Katz's ES Components

## tl;dr

git commit ...
npm run build
npm version {major,minor,patch}
npm publish

## Publish

``` npm publish ```

## Update

To increment the patch version (e.g., from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2), run npm version patch.
To increment the minor version (e.g., from 0.0.1 to 0.1.0), run npm version minor.
To increment the major version (e.g., from 0.0.1 to 1.0.0), run npm version major.

### Semver

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
